# Banking-Program
A simple console-based banking application built in Java. This program allows users to:

- Create a new account with a username and password
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Check their account balance
- View transaction history (deposit history)

The program demonstrates basic Java concepts, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Data structures (ArrayLists)
- File input/output operations
- Exception handling

This project was developed as a personal exercise to practice Java programming skills.
